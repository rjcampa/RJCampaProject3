Project3 is a classic arcade game replica playable on most browsers.
The game utilizes the <canvas> element, available in HTML5, to render
the graphics. The goal of the game is to guide the main character across
the stage while dodging enemy bugs.  Once the player crosses the stage,
the game resets to the next level.

Installation
===============================
Installation is not needed.  Run 'index.html' from the Project3 folder
to run the game in your default browser.

Controls
===============================
The arrow keys are used to control the main character. The character cannot
navigate outside the stage.
